# How to get started with the GroupStart Project

1. Install XAMPP if you do not already have it. XAMPP is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package.

2. Place the GroupStart folder (available on github: https://github.com/stevenroach7/groupstart) in the htdocs folder of XAMPP.

3. Use the XAMPP Application Manager (or the terminal) to run Apache and MySql. When they are both running, navigate to localhost/groupstart (or any other page in the project) to see the project. We did not change any of the default settings after installing XAMPP.
