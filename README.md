# GroupStart
GroupStart is an experimental, alpha-stage application that seeks to facilitate the early stages of an online group project. GroupStart has been taken over by a GroupLens PhD candidate so this repository is no longer maintained. Check out GroupStartPosterAlliyuRoach.pdf to see a poster we presented and get a sense of the research goals of GroupStart.
